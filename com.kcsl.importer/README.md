# Non-program Artifacts Importer

This plugin project imports specific non-program artifacts from processed datasets attached to this plugin and injects the information in the Atlas CodeMap.

Currently, we import Bugzilla issues and record commits for the Apache POI project used for the DySDoc3 Challenge.
