# Supplementary Artifacts Importer

This project imports specific supplementary artifacts from different sources and/or processed datasets (e.g., Bugzilla issues, commit records information) and injects the imported information into the Atlas Code Map.

Currently, we import Bugzilla issues, record commits, and baseline JavaDoc infor for the Apache POI project used for the DySDoc3 Challenge.
